# DemoDashApp
This is a minimal Dash app created using a sample .csv file containing simulated website performance data. The app visualizes the data to help analyze the performance of a simulated website.

# Features:
Interactive plots to visualize website performance metrics
Data is loaded from a CSV file
Simple, intuitive layout for ease of use

# Installation and Setup:
1. Create a new parent directory for your project: mkdir website-performance-dash-app && cd website-performance-dash-app
2. Create a new virtual environment: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate (on macOS/Linux): source venv/bin/activate
4. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the Dash app: python app.py

# Customizing the App:
Feel free to modify the app by:

Updating the CSV file with new data
Adjusting the layout or adding more Dash components
Adding additional functionality such as filtering or user inputs
